Problem: 
Given a set of E linear equations mod P over V variables, find an assignment to the variables such that the
maximum number of equations are satisfied (it may be impossible to satisfy them all). Each equation will
involve exactly two different variables. P is assumed to be prime.Algorithm:How we algorithm works is it first creates a HashMap, map, that maps a string'x_b + " " x_d' to a LinkedList<Triple>, where Triple is a class that contains the values {a, c, e}. So every equation that contains the same x_b and x_d value will be in the same LinkedList.Then we sorted the Collection<LinkedList<Triple>> listOfBins = map.values()based on the size of each LinkedList so that we try to optimize set of equationsthat use the same two variables, x_b and x_d. After we find the optimal value, x_b and x_d for this set, we iterate through listOfBins and continue the process. Since each bin may use a variable already defined, we will just use that value forthat variable and optimize the other variable to satisfy the most equations for each set of equations. If we reach a set of equations that already have variables defined, we skip that bin.After iterating through each LinkedList set of equations, all of our variables shouldbe defined. To optimize this even further, we noticed that the variables that satisfy the most equationsof the first biggest set of equations may not optimize the overall solution. So instead,we move the first set and add it to the end of the listOfBins and run the same algorithm, with the next biggest set at the front. If we satisfy a greater number of total equations, we use these variables instead.
